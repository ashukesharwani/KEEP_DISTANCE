# KEEP_DISTANCE
The COVID-19 epidemic had a significant influence on a number of countries. A person faces the danger of catching this sickness by getting into contact with any sick or virus-carrying person who has sneezed or coughed, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. For preventative measures, the WHO advises maintaining a social distance and regularly washing your hands. It might be difficult to keep your distance from others. Therefore, a smart gadget called "KEEP DISTANCE" was created that will warn users if someone approaches from a distance of less than 1 m. Additionally, when the alarm beeps, it will alert them with bright LED glows, and an OLED display will show how far apart the people are.The distance will also be displayed to create awareness."Keep distance" ensures that people maintain at least 1 metre of distance from each other. This distance can be changed according to users' preferences.
